            <h1>A Lesson of Tesla Crashes? Computer Vision Can’t Do It All Yet</h1>
            <p>Jitendra Malik, a researcher in computer vision for three decades, doesn’t own a Tesla, but he has advice for people who do.</p>
            <p>
“Knowing what I know about computer vision, I wouldn’t take my hands off the steering wheel,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Malik, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, was referring to a fatal crash in May of a Tesla electric car that was equipped with its Autopilot driver-assistance system. An Ohio man was killed when his Model S car, driving in the Autopilot mode, crashed into a tractor-trailer.
            </p>
            <p>
    Federal regulators are still investigating the accident. But it appears likely that the man placed too much confidence in Tesla’s self-driving system. The same may be true of a fatal Tesla accident in China that was reported last week. Other automakers like Ford, which last week announced its plan to produce driverless cars by 2021, are taking a go-slow approach, saying the technology for even occasional hands-free driving is not ready for many traffic situations.
